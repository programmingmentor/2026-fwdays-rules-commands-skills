# Prompt: Generate Cursor Rules for My Project

You are an expert software engineer helping to create comprehensive Cursor rules (`.cursorrules` file) for a project. Cursor rules help guide AI assistants in understanding project context, coding standards, and best practices.

## Project Information

Please provide the following information about your project:

### 1. Project Overview
- **Project name**: [e.g., "Slidev Presentation Project"]
- **Project type**: [e.g., "Web application", "API", "Library", "Presentation"]
- **Primary purpose**: [Brief description of what the project does]

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Languages**: [e.g., TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.]
- **Frameworks**: [e.g., Vue 3, React, Next.js, Express, etc.]
- **Build tools**: [e.g., Vite, Webpack, npm, yarn, etc.]
- **Testing**: [e.g., Jest, Vitest, Playwright, etc.]
- **Other tools**: [e.g., Prettier, ESLint, etc.]

### 3. Project Structure
- **Key directories**: [e.g., "components/", "pages/", "public/", "layouts/"]
- **File naming conventions**: [e.g., "kebab-case", "PascalCase", etc.]
- **Code organization patterns**: [e.g., "feature-based", "layer-based", etc.]

### 4. Coding Standards
- **Code style**: [e.g., "Prefer functional components", "Use TypeScript strict mode"]
- **Naming conventions**: [e.g., "camelCase for variables", "PascalCase for components"]
- **Comments**: [e.g., "Use JSDoc for public APIs", "Minimal inline comments"]
- **Error handling**: [e.g., "Always use try-catch", "Return Result types"]

### 5. Dependencies & Patterns
- **Key libraries**: [e.g., "@slidev/cli", "vue", etc.]
- **Design patterns**: [e.g., "Composition API", "Component-based architecture"]
- **State management**: [e.g., "Pinia", "Vuex", "Context API", etc.]

### 6. Development Workflow
- **Git workflow**: [e.g., "Conventional commits", "Feature branches"]
- **Branch naming**: [e.g., "feature/", "fix/", "docs/"]
- **Commit messages**: [e.g., "Conventional commits format"]

### 7. Platform & Environment
- **OS**: [e.g., "Windows 11", "macOS", "Linux"]
- **Terminal**: [e.g., "Git Bash", "PowerShell", "zsh"]
- **Node version**: [e.g., "Node 18+", "Node 20"]
- **Package manager**: [e.g., "npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]

### 8. Special Requirements
- **Accessibility**: [e.g., "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"]
- **Performance**: [e.g., "Optimize for bundle size", "Lazy load components"]
- **Security**: [e.g., "Sanitize user inputs", "Use environment variables"]
- **Internationalization**: [e.g., "Support Ukrainian and English"]

### 9. AI Assistant Preferences
- **Communication style**: [e.g., "Be concise", "Explain reasoning"]
- **Code generation**: [e.g., "Always include TypeScript types", "Prefer composition over inheritance"]
- **Documentation**: [e.g., "Generate JSDoc comments", "Update README when adding features"]

## Instructions for Generating Rules

Based on the information provided above, generate a comprehensive `.cursorrules` file that includes:

1. **Project Context**: Brief overview of the project and its purpose
2. **Technology Stack**: List of technologies and versions used
3. **Code Style Guidelines**: Specific coding standards and conventions
4. **File Structure**: Expected project organization
5. **Naming Conventions**: Rules for naming files, variables, functions, etc.
6. **Best Practices**: Project-specific best practices and patterns
7. **Common Patterns**: Frequently used patterns and idioms
8. **Avoid**: Anti-patterns and things to avoid
9. **Testing**: Testing approach and requirements
10. **Documentation**: Documentation standards
11. **Platform Considerations**: OS-specific commands and paths
12. **Language Preferences**: Communication language (English/Ukrainian)

## Output Format

Generate the rules in a clear, structured format suitable for a `.cursorrules` file. Use clear sections, bullet points, and examples where helpful. Keep rules actionable and specific rather than vague.
