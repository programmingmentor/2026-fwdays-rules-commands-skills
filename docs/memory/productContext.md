# Product Context

## Why this workshop exists

Ad-hoc prompting doesn’t scale: it produces inconsistent results and burns time.
This workshop shows how to make agent behavior **predictable** and **team-friendly**.

## UX goals for the deck

- Slides are concise and readable on a projector
- Core concepts repeat with consistent terminology
- Sources are present, but mostly in speaker notes

## Key messages

- Agentic IDE = Context + Tools + Memory
- Guardrails + verification loops are mandatory
- Treat rules/skills as version-controlled engineering assets
