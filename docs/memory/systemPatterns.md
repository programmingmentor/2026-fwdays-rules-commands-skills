# System Patterns (Deck Patterns)

## Slide organization

- Entry point: `slides.md`
- Theoretical part is split into modules under `pages/theory/`
- Use `src:` imports to keep the deck maintainable

## Visual patterns

- Use `v-clicks` for progressive reveal
- Prefer Mermaid diagrams for workflows/hierarchies
- Use images from `public/` only when they add real value

## Content patterns

- Ukrainian text with key English terms in parentheses on first mention
- Keep citations as speaker notes (HTML comments) when possible
